# What's logrotate
logrotate is designed to ease administration of systems that generate large numbers of log files.
It allows automatic rotation, compression, removal, and mailing of log files.
Each log file may be handled daily, weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large.

# How to use it in lambda
Because we use irteam/irteamsu account to deploy lambda and logrotate configuration's owner must be root,
so we can't generate logrotate configuration automatically(e.g. /etc/logrotate.d/lambda).
In order to solve above permission denied problem, we must generate the logrotate configuration file manually.

After deploy all components, `/tmp/create-logrotate.sh` will be generated by lambda's ansible task,
then, execute below shell script on target node using `root` account
```
/tmp/create-logrotate.sh <logDir> #e.g. /tmp/create-logrotate.sh /home/irteamsu/lambda/wsklogs
```
Linux's cron daemon will schedule the logrotate task automatically.
